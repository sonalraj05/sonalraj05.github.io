            <p class="title1">Drive</p>
            <p> The drive is the base of the robot and enables movement as well as facilitating other components such as intakes and lifts. A good drive also has the added benefits of protecting fragile internal parts such as thin three-pin wires and the brain/cortex. </p>
            <p>There are many types of drives and all of them have their pros and cons. The drive that you choose mainly depends on the active game released by VEX Robotics. Before considering the pros and cons of the drive types, turning scrub must be addressed.</p>
            <p>Turning scrub is the friction a robot experiences while turning. This must be kept to a minimum to increase the efficiency of the robot’s movement and as a result, the speed at which you score points in a match. A robot turns most efficiently when the wheels are tangents to the turning circle (fig. 1). The further the front and back wheels are from each other, the more friction there is. In the image below, the first two images have the wheels at a tangent to the turning circle.</p>
            <i>Tank Drive</i>
            <p>This is the drive that most people new to Vex Robotics start by creating. A tank drive consists of any number of wheels all facing in one direction with two independently controlled sides. Fig. 2 shows an example of a tank drive. </p>
            <p>The advantages of using this drivetrain in competition are that it has the most traction to the field and is very difficult to push. This drivetrain is also generally compact compared to other types of drives, as a result of this, you can fit other components easier into the robot. The robot is also very easy to program.</p>
            <p>Tank drive is very stable but for this stability, you trade off the ease of turning and experience more turning scrub. This is because the way the drive turns is by sliding across the ground. In a tank drive, not one wheel is at a tangent to the turning circle.</p>
            <i>X – Drive</i>
            <p>This drive is the drive that is utilised by robots that require more complex movement. This drive can strafe which makes it very useful for the autonomous period in the vex competitions because of the time it can save. The wheels are positioned at 45 degrees inwards. An example of a x – drive is shown by fig. 3.</p>
            <p>However, if the drive is built to a high standard, it will give you a very big advantage when in competition because of the strafing. X – drives are also faster than tank drives so can help your team score points quicker.</p>
            <p>This drive is very difficult to build and program so may not be the one for very new builders but nevertheless the option is there. There is also less space compared to a tank drive to fit game object manipulators as well as sensors. Although the x – drive is faster, there is significantly less torque. </p>
            <i>Mecanum drive</i>
            <p>A mecanum drive is a mix of both x – drive and tank drive. A mecanum drive has the ability to strafe albeit at a slower speed, but all the wheels face the same direction. This type of drive utilises mecanum wheels (fig.4) to do this.</p>
            <p>A mecanum drive is significantly easier to code compared to a x drive but also easier to build because it is just a tank drive with different wheels on it. It will provide all the advantages of a x drive but with the slow speed and the high torque of a tank drive.</p>
            <p>However, a lot of problems can occur because of mecanum wheels. They tend to become stuck and do not strafe properly. They also waste a lot of space because they are so wide.</p>
